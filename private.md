This is the already done setup from shadcn

Change this global css in a good theme so that my project theme looks good not just simple dark color

i don't want to use gradients colors and too much things that looks like my project is AI generated

just change global css so that my whole project will adapt automatically.

or you can also give me versions of global css so that i will choose among them

but i want sleek nice you(without too much animations and gradient colors)
